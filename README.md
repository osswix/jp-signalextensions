# JP+ Multiaspect Signals

The JP+ multiaspect signals are based on the original signals, the initial release will be formed from an extended variation on the original graphics introducing aspects as seen in Japanese signals. In following releases i will touch up on these signals and release additional signals created with original art fitting within the style of the japan set. This set is aimed to work in addition to the original Japanese signal set, whose signals are usable as a fallback for this set.

## what is this?

Multiple aspect signals based on the original japanese signal set. JGR's patch pack is required to be able to make use of this signal pack, as they will appear as new styles. For multiple aspects to properly function the train breaking model must be set to realistic.

## how do i use this?

This set is an extension to the original japanese signals; in the current state multiple aspect signals are split into catagories for amount of lamps included in the signal, and split between semaphores/electric lights to differ between lights that support more near-green aspects (electric) and the double yellow aspects intended to show a restricted speed limit (in the semaphores group). High speed signals are an exception to this, in which case the semaphores contain six lamps wheras the electric contains five lamps. In this case as well the semaphore, six lamp, variant contains a restricted speed aspect, unlike the five lamp version.
Because there is currently two versions, the multiaspect will show 2 caution lamps in a row.
